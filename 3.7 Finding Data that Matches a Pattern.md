#### SQL Used
Placing the percent symbol (`%`) any where in a string in conjunction with the `LIKE` keyword will operate as a wildcard. Meaning it can be substituted by any number of characters, including zero!
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> LIKE <pattern>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT title FROM books WHERE title LIKE "Harry Potter%Fire";
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE title LIKE "Alien%";
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name LIKE "%drew";
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE "%Brief History%";
```
#### PostgreSQL Specific Keywords
`LIKE` in PostgreSQL is case-sensitive. To case-insensitive searches do `ILIKE`.
```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name ILIKE "%drew";
```
