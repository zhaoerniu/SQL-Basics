#### SQL Used
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> BETWEEN <lesser value> AND <greater value>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 9.99 AND 19.99;
SELECT name, appointment_date FROM appointments WHERE appointment_date BETWEEN "2015-01-01" AND "2015-01-07";
```
