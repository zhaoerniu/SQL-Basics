##### SQL Used
Retrieving a single column:

```
SELECT <column name> FROM <table name>; 
```

Examples:

```
SELECT email FROM users;
SELECT first_name FROM users;
SELECT name FROM products;
SELECT zip_code FROM addresses;
```

Retrieving multiple columns:

```
SELECT <column name 1>, <column name 2>, ... FROM <table name>;
```

Examples:

```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers;
SELECT name, description, price FROM products;
SELECT title, author, isbn, year_released FROM books;
SELECT name, species, legs FROM pets;
```
