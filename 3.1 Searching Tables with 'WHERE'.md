#### SQL Used
##### A `WHERE` Clause
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition>;
```
##### Equality Operator
Find all rows that a given value matches a column's value.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> = <value>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name = "Andrew";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name = "Chalkley";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count = 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published = 1999;
```
##### Inequality Operator
Find all rows that a given value doesn't match a column's value.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> != <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> <> <value>;
```
The not equal to or inequality operator can be written in two ways != and <>. The latter is less common.

Examples:
```
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE first_name != "Kenneth";
SELECT first_name, email FROM users WHERE last_name != "L:one";
SELECT name AS "Product Name" FROM products WHERE stock_count != 0;
SELECT title "Book Title" FROM books WHERE year_published != 2015;
```
