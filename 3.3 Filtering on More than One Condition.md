#### SQL Used
You can compare multiple values in a `WHERE` condition. If you want to test that *both* conditions are true use the `AND` keyword, or *either* conditions are true use the `OR` keyword.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> AND <condition 2> ...;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> OR <condition 2> ...;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE last_name = "Chalkley" AND first_name = "Andrew";

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = "Games Consoles" AND price < 400;

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title = "The Matrix" OR title = "The Matrix Reloaded" OR title = "The Matrix Revolutions";

SELECT country FROM countries WHERE population < 1000000 OR population > 100000000;
```
