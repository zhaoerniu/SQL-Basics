#### Relational Operators
There are several relational operators you can use:
* `<` less than
* `<=` less than or equal to
* `>` greater than
* `>=` greater than or equal to
These are primarily used to compare *numeric* and *date/time* types.
```
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> < <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> <= <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> > <value>;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column name> >= <value>;
```
Examples:
```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE date_of_birth < '1998-12-01';
SELECT title AS "Book Title", author AS Author FROM books WHERE year_released <= 2015;
SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE price > 9.99;
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE release_year >= 2000;
```
